# SQL Workshop - Week 4

We've spent 3 weeks looking at the Northwind database and developing our understanding of how to build complex queries involving multiple tables. We also used the Franchise app to explore an SQLite file.

Today we are going to changes things a bit and look at a different data set, using a different SQL client.

## The Data

<a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/6bed41cd-9816-4912-a2b8-b0b224909396" target="_blank">Government of Canadaâ€™s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory</a>

We'll be using a modified version of table 5.


## The Environment

We'll be using a platform called <a href="https://datasette.io/" target="_blank">Datasette</a> that is full featured set of tools that allows you to explore data from spreadsheets and turn them into SQL. We are using a web-based version of this called <a href="https://lite.datasette.io/" target="_blank">Datasette Lite</a>

# Let's begin

<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/DASA_2023_SQL_Collaboration/main/Emissions.csv" target="tutorial">Start</a> the environment and view the Data.


# Examples to Get Ready

Before clicking through, try to read the query and determine what it will do...

**Example 1**

```SQL 
SELECT "Fiscal year", count(*) from "Emissions" GROUP BY "Fiscal year"
```
<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/DASA_2023_SQL_Collaboration/main/Emissions.csv#/data?sql=SELECT+%22Fiscal+year%22%2C+count%28*%29+from+%22Emissions%22+GROUP+BY+%22Fiscal+year%22" target="tutorial">View in Action</a>


**Example 2**

```SQL
SELECT "Federal organization", count(*) FROM "Emissions" WHERE "Energy category" LIke "natural gas" GROUP BY "Federal organization" ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```
<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/DASA_2023_SQL_Collaboration/main/Emissions.csv#/data?sql=SELECT+%22Federal+organization%22%2C+count%28*%29+FROM+%22Emissions%22+WHERE+%22Energy+category%22+LIke+%22natural+gas%22+GROUP+BY+%22Federal+organization%22+ORDER+BY+COUNT%28*%29+DESC" target="tutorial">View in Action</a>


**Example 3**

```SQL
SELECT "Fiscal year", AVG("Energy use (GJ)") from "Emissions" GROUP BY "Fiscal year"
```

<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/DASA_2023_SQL_Collaboration/main/Emissions.csv#/data?sql=SELECT+%22Fiscal+year%22%2C+AVG%28%22Energy+use+%28GJ%29%22%29+from+%22Emissions%22+GROUP+BY+%22Fiscal+year%22" target="tutorial">View in Action</a>

**Example 4**

```SQL
SELECT * FROM "Emissions" WHERE	"Energy category" LIKE "gasoline"
```

<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/DASA_2023_SQL_Collaboration/main/Emissions.csv#/data?sql=SELECT+*+FROM+%22Emissions%22+WHERE%09%22Energy+category%22+LIKE+%22gasoline%22" target="tutorial">View in Action</a>
